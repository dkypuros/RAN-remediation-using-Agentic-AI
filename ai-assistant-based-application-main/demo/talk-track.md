## Application Walkthrough

### Welcome & Setup (Show Welcome Page)

"The application starts with this intuitive welcome page that guides users through a simple four-step process:

1. **Connect to JIRA**: Users authenticate with their JIRA credentials to access their organization's ticket database, or they can use our demo mode for evaluation purposes.

2. **Create New Tickets**: When creating tickets, our AI automatically analyzes the content in real-time to identify similar past issues. This happens as the user types, providing immediate feedback.

3. **Review Similar Tickets**: The system presents relevant historical tickets with valuable context including:
   - Previous resolution steps that worked
   - Average resolution time metrics
   - Subject matter experts who resolved similar issues
   - Root cause patterns across similar tickets
   - Knowledge base articles related to the issue

4. **Apply AI Recommendations**: Our AI assistant provides actionable insights like:
   - Suggested resolution steps based on historical success
   - Estimated time-to-resolution predictions
   - Intelligent categorization and priority recommendations
   - Relevant knowledge base article suggestions
   - Potential workarounds while permanent solutions are developed"

## Demo Q&A Preparation

**Q: How does the AI model get trained on our specific ticket data?**

A: The system uses a combination of pre-trained language models and fine-tuning on your historical ticket data. During implementation, we'll work with your team to securely process your ticket history, ensuring the AI understands your specific domain terminology and common issues.

**Q: What about data privacy and security?**

A: The application is designed with security in mind. All data processing can happen within your own infrastructure when deployed on-premises. We support data masking for sensitive information and comply with enterprise security standards.

**Q: How does this integrate with our existing JIRA workflows?**

A: The AI Ticket Assistant integrates with JIRA's API to synchronize ticket data while maintaining all your existing workflows and automation rules. It adds an intelligence layer without disrupting established processes.

**Q: What kind of performance improvements can we expect?**

A: Based on implementations with similar organizations, teams typically see a 30-40% reduction in average resolution time, 25% decrease in escalations, and significant improvements in customer satisfaction scores after full adoption.
