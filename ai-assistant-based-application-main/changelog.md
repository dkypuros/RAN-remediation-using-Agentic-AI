  - Background task for simulating realistic network activity
  - OpenShift deployment configurations with health checks

- **RAN Services API** (`ran-services/`)
  - Extended Flask API with 8 new live simulator proxy endpoints
  - Combined site analysis endpoint merging live and fixture data
  - JSON data fixtures: alarms, KPIs, cell details, remediation playbooks
  - Health check endpoint with simulator connectivity status
  - Environment-based configuration for simulator URL

- **Frontend Enhancements**
  - Replaced "Team Members" page with "Agentic Workflows" page
  - Chat interface demonstrating AI-driven RAN troubleshooting
  - 5 information tabs: Activity, Data, Services, Fixtures, Retrieval
  - Agent step visualization showing reasoning and action flow
  - Retrieved data display with syntax highlighting
  - Real-time agent processing indicators

- **Deployment Automation**
  - `deploy-ran-simulator.sh` - Automated simulator deployment script
  - `deploy-ran-services.sh` - Automated services deployment script
  - `deploy-all-ran.sh` - Combined deployment for all RAN components
  - Comprehensive `RAN-INTEGRATION.md` documentation

- **Data Fixtures**
  - 4 active alarms (CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR severities)
  - 4 site KPI reports with accessibility, retainability, integrity metrics
  - Cell details for 3 sites with RF measurements
  - 4 remediation playbooks with diagnostic and remediation steps

### Changed
- Updated sidebar navigation to use "Agentic Workflows" instead of "Team Members"
- Enhanced `/app/api/ran-agent/route.ts` with comprehensive demo responses
- Modified RAN agent to show explicit retrieval, analysis, and solution phases
- Improved agent step tracking with reasoning and action types

### Technical Details
- Simulator provides 4 sites: SITE-001 (healthy), SITE-002 (degraded with S1 link failure), SITE-003 (healthy), SITE-004 (warning)
- SITE-002 demonstrates critical alarm scenario with transport link failure matching fixture data
- Combined endpoint correlates live cell states with synthetic alarms and KPIs
- Agent demonstrates full troubleshooting workflow: query → retrieval → analysis → remediation
