### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.consulting.redhat.com/coe-telco-ai-demos/repeatable-demo/ai-assistant-based-application.git
cd ai-assistant-based-application

# Install dependencies
npm install

## Red Hat OpenShift AI Integration

### Setting Up OpenShift AI

1. Go to the website: [https://demo.redhat.com](https://demo.redhat.com)

2. Log in using your Red Hat SSO credentials.

3. Order the OpenShift AI catalog item: [RHOAI Catalog](https://catalog.demo.redhat.com/catalog?item=babylon-catalog-prod/sandboxes-gpte.ocp4-composer-ai.prod&utm_source=webapp&utm_medium=share-link)

4. Fill in any required information and submit the order.

5. Wait for the environment to be instantiated. This may take around **30â€“60 minutes**.

### Accessing the vLLM Server

1. Open the RHOAI dashboard.

2. Navigate to the Model Serving section.

3. Locate the serving runtime named vLLM and get the inference endpoint.

### Testing the API

```bash
curl -X POST "https://vllm-composer-ai-apps.apps.cluster-sptk8.sptk8.sandbox305.opentlc.com/v1/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "vllm",
  "prompt": "What is artificial intelligence?",
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "stream": false
}'
```

### Connecting the Application to the API

To configure the AI Ticket Assistant to use the vLLM API endpoint:

1. Update the environment variables in your `.env.local` file (for local development) or in the OpenShift deployment configuration:

```
VLLM_API_ENDPOINT=https://vllm-composer-ai-apps.apps.cluster-sptk8.sptk8.sandbox305.opentlc.com/v1/completions
VLLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_if_required
```

2. Restart the application to apply the changes
