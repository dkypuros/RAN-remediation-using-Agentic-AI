# RAN Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Session**: Hybrid 5G RAN Simulator Integration

## Objective

Integrate a simplified 5G RAN simulator with the AI assistant application to demonstrate agentic workflows for network troubleshooting and remediation.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. RAN Simulator Created
**Location**: `ai-assistant-based-application-main/ran-simulator/`

**Files Created:**
- `gnb.py` - Flask-based 5G gNodeB simulator (800+ lines)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` - Container build configuration
- `README.md` - Simulator documentation

**Features Implemented:**
- 4 simulated sites (SITE-001, SITE-002, SITE-003, SITE-004)
- 11 cells with realistic RF metrics (SINR, RSRP, RSRQ)
- Dynamic UE connection simulation
- Background thread for realistic network activity
- Site status tracking (OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED, WARNING)
- SITE-002 configured with CELL-2B DOWN to match alarm fixtures

**API Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Health check
- `/gnb/sites` - Get all sites
- `/gnb/sites/<site_id>` - Get specific site
- `/gnb/cells` - Get all cells
- `/gnb/cells/<cell_id>` - Get specific cell
- `/gnb/ues` - Get UE contexts
- `/gnb/metrics` - Get overall metrics
- `/gnb/status` - Get gNodeB status

### 2. RAN Services Extended

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Frontend (Next.js)
    ↓
RAN Agent API (/api/ran-agent)
    ↓
vLLM Service (reasoning)
    ↓
RAN Services (Flask:5000)
    ├─→ Fixtures (alarms, KPIs, playbooks)
    └─→ RAN Simulator (Flask:5001)
         └─→ Live cells, UEs, metrics
```

### Hybrid Data Strategy

**Live Simulator Data:**
- Real-time cell states (ACTIVE/DOWN)
- Dynamic UE connections
- RF metrics updated continuously
- Site operational status

**Fixture Data:**
- Alarms with severity levels
- KPI thresholds and violations
- Detailed remediation playbooks
- Historical issue patterns

**Combined Analysis:**
- Correlates live cell states with alarms
- Matches KPI degradation with RF metrics
- Suggests remediation based on symptoms
- Provides comprehensive troubleshooting view

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Hybrid Architecture?
- **Live data**: Demonstrates real network dynamics
- **Fixtures**: Provides rich context (alarms, playbooks)
- **Combined**: Best of both worlds for demo

### 2. Why Flask for Both Services?
- Consistency across backend services
- Simple, lightweight, fast deployment
- Easy integration with OpenShift
- Compatible with existing ran-services patterns

### 3. Why Simplified vs Full 5G Core?
- Focus on RAN components relevant to demo
- Removed BlueField-3 DPU dependencies
- Eliminated complex NRF registration flows
- Faster builds and simpler debugging

### 4. Why Site-Based Organization?
- Matches real-world network operations
- Easier for users to understand
- Aligns with KPI reporting structure
- Natural grouping for troubleshooting

## Integration with Existing Code

### Preserved Components
- All existing ran-services fixture endpoints
- All existing frontend pages
- All existing deployment configurations
- vLLM and RAG service integrations

### New Components
- RAN Simulator service (new microservice)
- Live proxy endpoints in ran-services
- Combined analysis endpoint
- Agentic Workflows page (replaced Team Members)

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing API endpoints still work
- No changes to vLLM or RAG services
- No changes to main application deployment
- Backward compatible with existing builds

## Deployment Instructions

## Session Notes

This integration successfully demonstrates the hybrid approach requested by the user. The code from the 5G-Sim folder has been adapted and integrated into the ai-assistant-based-application-main project, enabling the eventual removal of the 5G-Sim folder as requested.

The implementation provides a complete end-to-end demonstration of agentic workflows for RAN troubleshooting, combining the realism of a live simulator with the rich context of curated data fixtures.
